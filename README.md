# weather-card
Created a simple weather card in JQuery utilising the FCC Glitch API to fetch the real-time weather data of user's locality and then using Google API (Location Maps) to map the name of the locality with the coordinates provided. Focussed on a minimalistic design of the card to provide simple UI/UX using HTML5, CSS, Animate.css on bootstrap framework.
